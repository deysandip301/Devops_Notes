# C2 - DevOps Fundamentals

## 1. DevOps Core Concepts
- DevOps = Dev + Ops collaboration.
- Goal: Deliver software faster, safer, and more reliably.
- Key: Break silos, automate, and iterate.

## 2. DevOps Lifecycle Stages
- Plan: Define requirements (Jira, Trello).
- Code: Write and version code (Git, GitHub).
- Build: Compile and package (Maven, Docker).
- Test: Automated quality checks (JUnit, pytest).
- Release: Prepare for deployment (Jenkins, GitLab CI).
- Deploy: Deliver to users (Kubernetes, Ansible).
- Operate: Run and monitor (Prometheus, ELK).
- Monitor: Gather feedback (Grafana, Datadog).

## 3. DevOps Principles
- Collaboration: Dev & Ops work together.
- Automation: Build, test, deploy, infra.
- CI/CD: Frequent integration and delivery.
- Measurement: Track metrics and health.
- Sharing: Knowledge and transparency.
- IaC: Infrastructure as code (Terraform).
- Feedback: Continuous improvement.

## 4. DevOps Best Practices
- Continuous Integration: Merge and test code often.
- Continuous Delivery/Deployment: Automate releases.
- Automated Testing: Ensure quality.
- Version Control: Track changes.
- Infrastructure as Code: Reproducible environments.
- Monitoring & Logging: Detect issues early.
- Collaboration: Shared responsibility.

## 5. DevOps Toolchain (Examples)
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
- CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- Containers: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- IaC: Terraform
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
- Collaboration: Slack, Teams

## 6. Key Takeaways
- DevOps is a culture, not just tools.
- Focus on automation, collaboration, and feedback.
- Aim for continuous, reliable software delivery.
